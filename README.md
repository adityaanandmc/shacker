Shipping tracker - 17track


## what
An small tool which does a headless crawl on 17track.net to gather details on what the delivery status of packages
Comes built in with automatic retires when too many requests are flooded onto 

## why
- needed to keep track of multiple shipments across different carriers all over the world
- Did not use their APIs as it would require establishing a series of dialogue. (Lotta work)

## how
- An out the box MEAN stack project
- Headless crawl via [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/)
